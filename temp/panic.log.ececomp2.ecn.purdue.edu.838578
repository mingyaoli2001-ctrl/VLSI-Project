Panic files have been created for cellviews that were opened in edit mode.


A panic file has been created for cellview 'tutorial/WallaceProject/schematic' at:
    (/home/ecegridfs/a/559mg81/tutorial/WallaceProject/schematic/sch.oa-)
To open the cellview with the recovered data:
    cellview = dbOpenPanicCellView("tutorial" "WallaceProject" "schematic")

A panic file has been created for cellview 'tutorial/FAdder/schematic' at:
    (/home/ecegridfs/a/559mg81/tutorial/FAdder/schematic/sch.oa-)
To open the cellview with the recovered data:
    cellview = dbOpenPanicCellView("tutorial" "FAdder" "schematic")

A panic file has been created for cellview 'tutorial/WM_testing/schematic' at:
    (/home/ecegridfs/a/559mg81/tutorial/WM_testing/schematic/sch.oa-)
To open the cellview with the recovered data:
    cellview = dbOpenPanicCellView("tutorial" "WM_testing" "schematic")

To restore a cellview using its panic file:
1. Open the cellview with the recovered data using 'dbOpenPanicCellView'
   (as noted above). The cellview opens in read-only mode.
2. Reopen the cellview in append mode using 'dbReopen(cellview "a")'.
3. Restore the recovered data to the cellview using 'dbSave(cellview)'.
   To save the recovered data to a different cellview, use
   'dbSave(cellview "lib" "cell" "view")' with the desired
   library, cell, and view information.
4. Remove the cellview from virtual memory using 'dbPurge(cellview)'.
   You may now open the restored cellView.
